| Sept 23 | 12:40-1:40 PM  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I thought about how to approach this problem more deeply, my current leading theory is to use binary search. It makes sense considering the one dimensional array, however I am currently thinking about how I will be able to differentiate the order in which the words appear in the text. I'll worry about that later as I write my binary search code. |

| Sept 26 |  3:30-4:30 PM  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I have a theory on how to solve the order problem. I was thinking I could maybe create a boolean variable that checks whether the current branch of the binary tree is more or less than it's parent. If it is, then it would become true, and then we would know to put that word before the previous one. |

I've spent this time working on my insert method, I found myself stuck for a bit so I worked on my actual spell check code. After I finished that I went back to working on my insert and lookup. I'm pretty much going char by char in a string and working through the Trie like that. |
| Oct 1   |  3:30-4:30 PM  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I spent the first half an hour finishing up my insert code, while spending the other half trying to complete my lookup. I used the same idea of a for loop iterating through the word char by char, except changing the function of lookup. I'm going to spend around another half an hour finishing up my lookup code. |

I MIGHT be going a little insane. |
| Oct 2   |     5-6 PM     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    After looking through my code very carefully, I have come to the conclusion that my constructors for Trie and TrieNode are causing the overflow issue. I changed both constructors, I made Trie take in a TrieNode and made TrieNode take in a boolean and TrieNode array, which seemed to fix the issue. However, my code unfortunately does not work. |
| Oct 4   |  3:30-4:30 PM  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             After a little bit of research, I found out about hashmaps, which seem really useful in trying to code this out. Since my current code doesn't work, I don't think it'll be a bad idea to try using a hashmap. I already have an idea using the containsKey() method, basically I would check if the children contain the current character within the Trie. I am going to work on this code over the weekend. |
| Oct 6   |  11AM - 12PM   |  Coding out the new hashmap insert went rather smoothly, it was in lookup where I found myself getting stuck. My code was off by a couple of missing words and I narrowed it down to my lookup code. I realized that my code was skipping over a couple of words due to my for loop, so I wrote code to break off from the loop so that it doesn't skip words. I did this by setting the current node as null so that it doesn't run on. I then checked if current is not null and it is a word and returned true if both statements were true and false if they weren't. This seemed to work, although honestly, I wasn't sure if my null current idea was going to work. |
